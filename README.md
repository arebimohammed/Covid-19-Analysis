This repository contains all the code for the project I wrote about in an article which can be found on my website [here](https://arebimohammed.github.io/covid19-interactive-analysis/).

As you can see the tag above opens the interactive analysis notebook in Binder which opens the voila jupyter notebook with all the analysis charts. You can also open it up on Heroku [here](https://covid19-interactive-app.herokuapp.com/)
